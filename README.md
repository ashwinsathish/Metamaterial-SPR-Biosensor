# High Resolution Aluminum-based Plasmonic Devices Using Metamaterials for Cancer Cell Detection

## Abstract
This project presents high-resolution Aluminum (Al)-based plasmonic devices in the near-infrared region, incorporating metamaterials to enhance detection accuracy and quality factor. The proposed plasmonic sensor utilizes a metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) configuration with Aluminum (Al) and Barium titanate (BTO) as high dielectric constant materials. A monolayer of Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is employed to enhance biomolecule adsorption on the sensor surface. The sensor is designed for the detection of cervical, blood, adrenal, and breast cancer cells, exhibiting high sensitivity and a significant figure of merit.

## Sensor Design
1. **Substrate:** Calcium fluoride (CaF₂) prism for minimal absorption in NIR.
2. **Metal Layers:** Aluminum (Al) layers (30 nm and 10 nm) for plasmonic resonance.
3. **Dielectric Layer:** Barium titanate (BTO, 5 nm) for enhanced field confinement.
4. **Metamaterial Layer:** 120 nm thick with engineered negative permittivity properties.
5. **Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂) Coating:** 2 nm layer to improve sensitivity.
6. **MoS₂ Monolayer:** 0.65 nm thick to facilitate biomolecule adsorption.

## Results
- Angle interrogation performed at 1550nm (near-IR spectrum).
- Sensor configurations analyzed for sensitivity, detection accuracy, quality factor, and FOM.
- The final configuration (Al-BTO-Al-Metamaterial-TiO₂-MoS₂) demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional designs.
  - **Sensitivity:** 101.2°/RIU
  - **Figure of Merit:** 5060 RIU⁻¹
- **Implications:** Detection of cancer cells: Cervical (HeLa), Blood (Jurkat), Adrenal (PC12), and Breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7)
